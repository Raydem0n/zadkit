/// Called just before presenting an interstitial. After this method finishes the interstitial will

/// Called just after dismissing an interstitial and it has animated off the screen.
- (void)interstitialDidDismissScreen:(ZADInterstitial *)ad;

/// Called just before the application will background or terminate because the user clicked on an

/// before this.
